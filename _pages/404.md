Bio
------
I am a Ph.D. student at Purdue EEE, advised by Prof. Sutherland. I received my Bachelor's degree in CSE at Korea University. and I earned my M.S. degree in EE at Korea University advised by Prof. Kim. My research is focused on Smart & Sustainable Manufacturing technologies enabled by data-driven techniques such as Artificial Intelligence (AI).
